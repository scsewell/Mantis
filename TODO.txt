//--RENDERER--
debug drawing (use one buffer with all lines for the frame)
look into resuing samplers (shared_ptr) for textures where possible
pool upload buffers (or use memory pool)
transfer queues?
upload image waits for each image one at a time, could batch them and have many fences waited on for all pending transfers...
review command buffer pooling (for starters, should pool by queuefamilyindex rather than queuetype, since queuetypes might alias the same queuefamily)

compute shader frustum culling?
